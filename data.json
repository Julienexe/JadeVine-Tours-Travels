Baraza Resort andï¿½Spa .ï¿½Named among CNNï¿½s Best Hotels in Africa, and located in northeast Zanzibar, on Bwejuu beach, Baraza Resort and Spa is a first class owner run beach resort. OVERVIEW Set in a garden of sand, lawns, succulents and palms, and traversed by white cobbled paths, Baraza Resort and Spa is unashamedly large, taking both its size and its Arabesque architectural flourishes ï¿½ domes, arches, mosaics, secret courtyards, huge doorways ï¿½ from the types of things visitors to the courts of the Sultans of Zanzibar might once have expected to see. Opulent, calm and looked after by the most welcoming of hosts (there are many, each as fine as the last), Baraza is a stone and timber build consisting of a main hotel and 30 sleeping rooms.ï¿½The main hotel includes multiple bars and restaurants, the Frangipani Spa, a couple of lounges, the Kids Club, a library, gym, business centre, shop, dive school and reception. Characterised by (tiny) tiled flooring, fountains, hanging brass lamps, benches set in alcoves, Zanzibari chests, highly decorated chairs and by great cooling throughways, the main hotel is both relaxing and vast. FOOD AND SERVICE The food is exceptional. Advertising its cuisine as Indian, Arabic, Swahili and Persian (Zanzibari), the kitchen at Baraza Resort and Spa specialises in spice and fish, but is equally adept at preparing pastas, meat dishes and the like. Breakfast and dinner (on selected nights) is served on the Livingston Terrace. Lunch ï¿½ buffet, snacks and easy cook ï¿½ can be found at the Ocean Lounge Bar and Restaurant, whilst dinner is best at the Sultanï¿½s Dining Room. Drinking ï¿½ wine, beer, spirits ï¿½ can be had at all three, and delicious cocktails are available at the Dhahabu Bar and Lounge. ACCOMMODATION The rooms or villas are divided into 5 classes: one bedroom Villa (7), Ocean Front one bedroom Villa (7), two bedroom Sultan View (5), two bedroom Garden View (10) and the Presidential Ocean Villa (ocean front). The one bedroom villas are a treat. White, flat roofed and approached by means of a stone path, each possesses a massive (Baraza has the effect of exhausting synonyms for large) four poster bed, a seating area, an en suite bathroom and private veranda.ï¿½The colouring is off white, beige, the woods both dark and light, and well-chosen plants, pots and artefacts add texture to a space otherwise sparse. The bathroom ï¿½ standalone bath, toilet, shower, twin sink ï¿½ is a joy. The two bedroom villas are similar, only bigger, while the Presidential suite is all about size and extra service, with separate accommodation provided for guestsï¿½ entourages. The complimentary Wi-Fi is outstanding.",

With incredible wildlife, scenery, and culture Kidepo offers a very unique off-the-beaten-track safari experience. Its location in the northeastern part of Uganda along the border with Both Kenya and South Sudan is the major reason why it has stayed fairly unnoticed and truly untouched by the world. The National park is transected by two seasonal rivers; river Kidepo and river Narus. In the wet seasons, these two rivers are like any other river (with flowing water and all that) but they amaze during the dry season. In the dry season, the river beds become dry and one can walk along the river bed. In case of very heavy rains, the rivers can also experience flash floods that will last only a few hours for the water to flow over into South Sudan. With more than 77 mammals and close to 500 bird species, Kidepo's most popular attraction is the wildlife and game viewing safaris. With animals such as Lions, Elephants, Giraffes, Zebras, Spotted hyena and leopard, Kidepo's variety in wild animals makes for perfect wilderness adventure.",

The park is located in the Murchison Conservation Area where we also find the Bugungu and Karuma wildlife reserves.ï¿½The park is endowed with several attractions including over 76 mammal species with four members of the big five, the lion, the leopards, the elephants, and the Buffaloes. Other species include bushbucks, Uganda kob, waterbucks and warthogs, giraffes, Jacksonï¿½s hartebeest, hyenas etc. Along the shores of the nile and within the waters you will see lots of hippos and crocodiles among other resident creatures. There also several primates in the Murchison falls national park including babaoons and several monkey species. Murchison Falls, also known asï¿½Kabalega Falls, is a waterfallï¿½between lake victoriaï¿½and lake albertï¿½on the victoria nileï¿½in Uganda. At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks, only 7ï¿½m (23ï¿½ft) wide, and tumbles 43ï¿½m (141ï¿½ft), before flowing westward into Lake Albert. The outlet of lake victoriaï¿½sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000ï¿½ftï¿½/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than 10ï¿½m (33ï¿½ft) wide.",

    "description": "The Rwenzori Mountains , previously called the Ruwenzori Range, is a mountain range of eastern equatorial Africa, located on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These mountains support glaciers and are one source of the Nile river. The Rwenzori Mountains reach heights up to 5,109 metres The Rwenzori Mountains are known for their vegetation, ranging from tropical rainforestï¿½through alpine meadowsï¿½to snow. The range supports its own species and varieties of gaint groudselï¿½and gaint lobeliaï¿½and even has a 6 metres (20ï¿½ft) tall heatherï¿½covered in mossï¿½that lives on one of its peaks. Most of the range is now a World Heritage Site and is covered jointly by the Rwenzori Mountains National Park in south-western Uganda and the Virunga National Park in the eastern DRC. There is no water shortage in the Rwenzori; yet, several members of the afro-alpine family resemble species that normally thrive in desert climates. The reason lies in their similar water economy. Water is not always readily available to the afroapineï¿½plants when they need it. In addition, nightly frosts affect the sap transport in the plants and the intake of water by its roots. As the day begins, the air temperature and radiation level rise rapidly, putting strenuous demands on the exposed parts of the plants as they try to meet the transpiration demands of the leaves and maintain a proper water balance. To counter the effects of freezing, the afro-alpine plants have developed the insulation systems that give them such a striking appearance. These adaptations become more prominent as the altitude increases.",
