Baraza Resort and\u00a0Spa .\u00a0Named among CNN\u2019s Best Hotels in Africa, and located in northeast Zanzibar, on Bwejuu beach, Baraza Resort and Spa is a first class owner run beach resort. OVERVIEW Set in a garden of sand, lawns, succulents and palms, and traversed by white cobbled paths, Baraza Resort and Spa is unashamedly large, taking both its size and its Arabesque architectural flourishes \u2013 domes, arches, mosaics, secret courtyards, huge doorways \u2013 from the types of things visitors to the courts of the Sultans of Zanzibar might once have expected to see. Opulent, calm and looked after by the most welcoming of hosts (there are many, each as fine as the last), Baraza is a stone and timber build consisting of a main hotel and 30 sleeping rooms.\u00a0The main hotel includes multiple bars and restaurants, the Frangipani Spa, a couple of lounges, the Kids Club, a library, gym, business centre, shop, dive school and reception. Characterised by (tiny) tiled flooring, fountains, hanging brass lamps, benches set in alcoves, Zanzibari chests, highly decorated chairs and by great cooling throughways, the main hotel is both relaxing and vast. FOOD AND SERVICE The food is exceptional. Advertising its cuisine as Indian, Arabic, Swahili and Persian (Zanzibari), the kitchen at Baraza Resort and Spa specialises in spice and fish, but is equally adept at preparing pastas, meat dishes and the like. Breakfast and dinner (on selected nights) is served on the Livingston Terrace. Lunch \u2013 buffet, snacks and easy cook \u2013 can be found at the Ocean Lounge Bar and Restaurant, whilst dinner is best at the Sultan\u2019s Dining Room. Drinking \u2013 wine, beer, spirits \u2013 can be had at all three, and delicious cocktails are available at the Dhahabu Bar and Lounge. ACCOMMODATION The rooms or villas are divided into 5 classes: one bedroom Villa (7), Ocean Front one bedroom Villa (7), two bedroom Sultan View (5), two bedroom Garden View (10) and the Presidential Ocean Villa (ocean front). The one bedroom villas are a treat. White, flat roofed and approached by means of a stone path, each possesses a massive (Baraza has the effect of exhausting synonyms for large) four poster bed, a seating area, an en suite bathroom and private veranda.\u00a0The colouring is off white, beige, the woods both dark and light, and well-chosen plants, pots and artefacts add texture to a space otherwise sparse. The bathroom \u2013 standalone bath, toilet, shower, twin sink \u2013 is a joy. The two bedroom villas are similar, only bigger, while the Presidential suite is all about size and extra service, with separate accommodation provided for guests\u2019 entourages. The complimentary Wi-Fi is outstanding."

Its location in the northeastern part of Uganda along the border with Both Kenya and South Sudan is the major reason why it has stayed fairly unnoticed and truly untouched by the world. The National park is transected by two seasonal rivers; river Kidepo and river Narus. In the wet seasons, these two rivers are like any other river (with flowing water and all that) but they amaze during the dry season. In the dry season, the river beds become dry and one can walk along the river bed. In case of very heavy rains, the rivers can also experience flash floods that will last only a few hours for the water to flow over into South Sudan. With more than 77 mammals and close to 500 bird species, Kidepo's most popular attraction is the wildlife and game viewing safaris. With animals such as Lions, Elephants, Giraffes, Zebras, Spotted hyena and leopard, Kidepo's variety in wild animals makes for perfect wilderness adventure."

It is famous for its annual migration of over 1.5 million white-bearded wildebeest and 250,000 zebra and for its numerous Nile crocodile and honey badger. The Maasai people\u00a0had been grazing their livestock in the open plains of eastern Mara Region\u00a0which they named \"endless plains,\" for around 200 years when the first European explorer, Austrian Oscar Baumann , visited the area in 1892. The name \"Serengeti\" is an approximation of the word used by the Maasai to describe the area, siringet , which means \"the place where the land runs on forever. The first American to enter the Serengeti, Stewart Edward White , recorded his explorations in the northern Serengeti in 1913. He returned to the Serengeti in the 1920s and camped in the area around Seronera for three months. During this time, he and his companions shot 50 lions. Because the hunting of lions made them scarce, the British colonial administration made a partial game reserve\u00a0of 800 acres (3.2\u00a0km2) in the area in 1921 and a full one in 1929. These actions were the basis for Serengeti National Park, which was established in 1951. The Serengeti gained more fame after the initial work of Bernhard Grzimek and his son Michael in the 1950s. Together, they produced the book and film s erengeti shall not die\u00a0widely recognized as one of the most important early pieces of nature conservation documentary."

The name of the crater has an\u00a0onomatopoeic\u00a0origin; it was named by the Maasai pastoralists after the sound produced by the cowbell\u00a0( ngoro ngoro ). Based on fossil evidence found at the Olduvai, various hominid\u00a0species have occupied the area for 3 million years. Hunter-gatherers were replaced by pastoralists\u00a0a few thousand years ago. The Mbulu\u00a0came to the area about 2,000 years ago and were joined by the Datooga\u00a0around the year 1700. Both groups were driven from the area by the Maasai\u00a0in the 1800s. No Europeans are known to have set foot in the Ngorongoro Crater until 1892, when it was visited by Oscar Baumann. Two German brothers (Adolph and Friedrich Siedentopf) farmed in the crater until the outbreak of World war l, after leasing the land from the administration of German East Africa. The brothers regularly organized shooting parties to entertain their German friends. They also attempted to drive the wildebeest\u00a0herds out of the crater."

These mountains support glaciers and are one source of the Nile river. The Rwenzori Mountains reach heights up to 5,109 metres The Rwenzori Mountains are known for their vegetation, ranging from tropical rainforest\u00a0through alpine meadows\u00a0to snow. The range supports its own species and varieties of gaint groudsel\u00a0and gaint lobelia\u00a0and even has a 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) tall heather\u00a0covered in moss\u00a0that lives on one of its peaks. Most of the range is now a World Heritage Site and is covered jointly by the Rwenzori Mountains National Park in south-western Uganda and the Virunga National Park in the eastern DRC. There is no water shortage in the Rwenzori; yet, several members of the afro-alpine family resemble species that normally thrive in desert climates. The reason lies in their similar water economy. Water is not always readily available to the afroapine\u00a0plants when they need it. In addition, nightly frosts affect the sap transport in the plants and the intake of water by its roots. As the day begins, the air temperature and radiation level rise rapidly, putting strenuous demands on the exposed parts of the plants as they try to meet the transpiration demands of the leaves and maintain a proper water balance. To counter the effects of freezing, the afro-alpine plants have developed the insulation systems that give them such a striking appearance. These adaptations become more prominent as the altitude increases."
